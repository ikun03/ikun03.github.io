<h1>Master's Thesis: Using AR and VR characters for enhancing user experience in a museum</h1>
<div style="width: 80%; margin: auto">
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        Museums and cultural heritage locations have used technology to create interactive
        exhibits and pedagogical tools that help spark visitors' interests.
        The rise of Augmented, Virtual and Mixed Reality Systems has further enabled the creation of a new
        generation of immersive experiences that can engage and educate visitors and audiences.
        These technologies can be used to develop digital characters that can serve as virtual
        tour guides and improve user engagement by answering questions and forming social bonds with the users.
        While such tour guides have been deployed as exhibits at many museums, the implementation is usually
        limited to a single exhibit or a section of the museum space. We believe that visitors will be better
        served if the virtual guide not only enriches the onsite experience but also provides a take-home
        experience for users to encourage future visits. So, for this thesis we are exploring the enhancement
        in user experience that such a system can bring by using onsite and offsite AR and WebVR
        technologies to create a virtual tour guide which assists visitors at the the Genesee Country Village
        & Museum through interactive dialog as they explore the museum space.
