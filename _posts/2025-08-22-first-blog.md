# My goal for blogging is to not have a goal at all
After years of being turned off by the amount of effort required, I finally decided to start writing a blog. A large amount of credit goes to Claude(not Monet, but his art is lovely), for making the setup a breeze so that I could focus on the content and design rather than the implementation itself. 

As I was writing this post, a niggling little voice at the back of my head kept asking me, "What is the purpose of another blog being added to an infinite ocean of currently existing blogs ?". I have to admit, it is kind of true. I do not expect my blog to add any groundbreaking ideas to the civilizational consciousness. 

I might occasionally post about ideas in Software Development, Computer Graphics, or other fields that I find interesting, but these won't be ideas that you wouldn't find anywhere else. Why then did I choose to consider that my ideas worthy of self-publishing on the internet ?

And that is when I remembered something that I had read recently in Oliver Burkerman's Four Thousand Weeks, In the book, Burkeman brings up the idea of an 'atelic activity'; an activity whose completion does not promise any reward, but rather the action becomes its own reward. As someone, whose only 'published writings' have been hastily scribbled technical manuals and software documents for internal users, the idea of writing down my actual flow of thought seems to be a refreshing change. The process of writing a post and publishing it on my own website feels like sending out a message in a bottle. The joy is not in seeing how far the bottle goes, but rather in the excitement of sending something into a world of possibilities. So with this thought, I am sending this post out in the world and if you have found it and read it, here's hoping you can find your atelic activity as well.
